	abstract = {After a century of research, the chronology of the first arrival of hominins in Europe remains controversial. Four Spanish localities potentially record evidence of the oldest Europeans, yet arrival ages remain loosely constrained between 1.6 and 0.9 Ma. Here we provide a new Early Pleistocene magnetostratigraphy, recording four paleomagnetic boundaries within 80 m of a fluvio-lacustrine sedimentary succession in Orce, southeastern Spain. This Pleistocene succession incorporates for the first time in Europe five superposed paleontological localities between the Olduvai and Jaramillo magnetozones, including three hominin sites providing evidence of the presence of hominins older than 1.07 Ma in Europe. The specific age for each fossil quarry is estimated using a Bayesian age-stratigraphic model with 95\% confidence intervals. The oldest sites, which lack evidence of hominin activity, are 1.60 ± 0.05 Ma and 1.35 ± 0.07 Ma, respectively. Three sites higher in the stratigraphy, which contain evidence of hominids, occur at 1.32 ± 0.07 Ma (Venta Micena), 1.28 ± 0.07 Ma (Barranco León-5), and 1.23 ± 0.06 Ma (Fuente Nueva-3). The magnetostratigraphy and paleontological content of the Orce hominin sites are compared with other European localities concluding that the new chronology for Orce represents Europe's oldest and most accurately dated early Pleistocene hominin records. These results indicate that African hominins with Oldowan technology reached Southwestern Europe {\textgreater}0.5 Ma after first leaving Africa. This diachronism is explained because Europe was limited by biogeographical barriers that hominins were able to surpass only in a later evolutionary/cultural stage. We propose that ∼1,3 Ma hominins first arrived in southern Europe by traversing the Strait of Gibraltar when in a similar time frame, crossed the Wallace Line and reached the island of Flores (Java) by navigating the wider Lombok Strait. Archaeological data shows that a second wave of hominins with Acheulian technology entered South Europe again via the Iberian Peninsula after the Jaramillo subchron (1.071–0.991 Ma) and before the Brunhes chron (0.77 Ma).},

Levels 10 and 10c (unit EVT7) have yielded abundant macrofauna and Mode 1 stone tools calibrated by paleomagnetism and by biostratigraphy to the upper limit of the Jaramillo subchron (0.98 Ma) and by ESR/U–series to 0.83 ± 0.13 Ma. The industries, elaborated from local raw materials, are small in size. The chaînes opératoires used for lithic production are poorly elaborated and are based on a bipolar on an anvil knapping technique. Retouched tools include notches, becs, scrapers and denticu-lates on small pebbles, clasts, fragments and flakes as well as a large single chopper. Based on the tech-no-typological comparison with other known Early Pleistocene sites in Europe, it has been proposed that these sites share a single technology with a variability range. Successive migratory episodes with biological and cultural exchange and independent evolution during the Early Pleistocene would imply the possibility of the development of regional technological traditions in Europe.},

	abstract = {This paper aims to update the information available on the lithic assemblage from the entire sequence of TD6 now that the most recent excavations have been completed, and to explore possible changes in both occupational patterns and technological strategies evidenced in the unit. This is the first study to analyse the entire TD6 sequence, including subunits TD6.3 and TD6.1, which have never been studied, along with the better-known TD6.2 Homo antecessor-bearing subunit. We also present an analysis of several lithic refits found in TD6, as well as certain technical features that may help characterise the hominin occupations. The archaeo-palaeontological record from TD6 consists of 9,452 faunal remains, 443 coprolites, 1,046 lithic pieces, 170 hominin remains and 91 Celtis seeds. The characteristics of this record seem to indicate two main stages of occupation. In the oldest subunit, TD6.3, the lithic assemblage points to the light and limited hominin occupation of the cave, which does, however, grow over the course of the level. In contrast, the lithic assemblages from TD6.2 and TD6.1 are rich and varied, which may reflect Gran Dolina cave’s establishment as a landmark in the region. Despite the occupational differences between the lowermost subunit and the rest of the deposit, technologically the TD6 lithic assemblage is extremely homogeneous throughout. In addition, the composition and spatial distribution of the 12 groups of lithic refits found in unit TD6, as well as the in situ nature of the assemblage demonstrate the high degree of preservation at the site. This may help clarify the nature of the Early Pleistocene hominin occupations of TD6, and raise reasonable doubt about the latest interpretations that support the ex situ character of the assemblage as a whole.},

	abstract = {The site of LuneryRosieres la-Terre-des-Sablons (Lunery, Cher, France) comprises early evidence of human occupation in mid-latitudes in Western Europe. It demonstrates hominin presence in the Loire River Basin during the Early Pleistocene at the transition between an interglacial stage and the beginning of the following glacial stage. Three archaeological levels sandwiched and associated with two diamicton levels deposited on the downcutting river floor indicate repeated temporary occupations. Lithic material yields evidence of simple and more complex core technologies on local Jurassic siliceous rocks and Oligocene millstone. Hominins availed of natural stone morphologies to produce flakes with limited preparation. Some cores show centripetal management and a partially prepared striking platform. The mean ESR age of 1175 ka ± 98 ka obtained on fluvial sediments overlying the archaeological levels could correspond to the transition between marine isotopic stages (MIS) 37 and 36, during the normal Cobb Mountain subchron, and in particular at the beginning of MIS 36. The Lunery site shows that hominins were capable of adapting to early glacial environmental conditions and adopting appropriate strategies for settling in mid-latitude zones. These areas cannot be considered as inhospitable at that time as Lunery lies at some distance from the forming ice cap.},

	abstract = {Evidence of earliest human settlements observed in the alluvial formations of the Middle Loire Basin during systematic surveys organised since 1981. Many stepped fluvial terraces deposited during the successive interglacial–glacial Quaternary cycles have been identified in three tributary valleys of the Loire River: the Creuse, Cher and Loir Valleys. These alluvial remnants were systematically dated by the Electron Spin Resonance (ESR) method applied on optically bleached quartz, in order to construct a chronostratigraphical framework for the fluvial systems and the associated archaeological localities. Four localities containing Early Palaeolithic industries with Mode 1 technology, occupied during the Lower Pleistocene, and ten sites characterized by assemblages with handaxes, discovered in the Middle Pleistocene alluvial formations, are described in this paper. These two sets of localities are characterized by lithic industries with many differences in supply of raw materials and in technical behaviours. The results indicate that this area was reached by two separate phases of human settlement (one in relation to Mode 1, the other to Mode 2) with an interval around 400ka, at the end of the Lower Pleistocene, during a period characterized by major climatic degradations.},
